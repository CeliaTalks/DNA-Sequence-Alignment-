Repository Name: DNA Sequence Alignment  
Repository Description: DNA sequence alignment code, based upon BLAST alignment methods, to compare two user entered custom sequences.

About the project. 

The purpose of this project is to align a DNA sequence to a reference DNA sequence, using user enteries, and display the outcome in an easy to read format.
The code first checks that the user enteries are in fact DNA sequence; only contains the correct bases (A, C, G, T). 
Then the length of the two sequences are compared and this result is outputted.
Finally a new variable was made to store the aligned sequences, comparing bases in each sequence up to 3 bases apart to determine the most efficient way to align them. Base shifts are represented by '-' and base replacements are represented by lower case letters.
